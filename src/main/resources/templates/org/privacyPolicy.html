    </div>

    <h5>The Purpose and Scope of this Policy</h5>
    <p>EntranceX is committed to protecting your privacy and creating a safe and secure online environment for anyone who visits and buys on our Services.

        This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explains what type of personal information EntranceX collects from or about you when you access or visit the our website, why and how we use it and the rights you have over your personal information. This policy also applies to the provision of our Services through third-party apps, sites and platforms.

        When used in this policy, the term 'personal information' refers to any information that relates to you as an identified or identifiable individual, such as your name, phone number, or email address.

        Certain goods or services, which you may access or purchase via the Services, are provided by our third-party partners, and protection of your information relating to such services will be governed by the privacy policy of such third parties.

        To better protect your privacy, we advise you to carefully read this privacy policy before accessing or using the Services. By accessing, browsing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agreed to the Privacy Policy described herein.

        EntranceX is referred to in this policy as "EntranceX", "we", "us" or "our", as the context requires. The term "you" (and "your", as applicable) refers to you, the individual using the Services.</p>


    <h5>Personal Information We Collect</h5>
    <h6>Information you provide</h6>

    <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you create (and later modify) your user account for the Services, while you access and use the Services or interact or correspond with us or with other users of the Services.

        This may include, for example, your name, email, phone number, date of birth, user names combined with passwords, security questions plus answers, financial information, free text notes, email correspondences with our customer support, favorite teams, shows or artists, purchase or viewing history, additional personal information which may be required in order to authenticate or identify you or the information you provide us with, etc.

        We do not intentionally process sensitive data other than information concerning your disabilities, which we collect for purposes of providing appropriate access to and/or special seats at the event premises.</p>

    <h5>Automatically-Collected Data</h5>

    <p>When you access or use the Site or Application, we automatically collect information about your visit, including:

        Log Information: We collect log information about your use of the Site, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our Site.
        Device Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Site, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers and mobile network information.
        Location Information: With your permission, we may collect information about the location of your device when you access or use the Application or otherwise consent to the collection of this information. For more details, please see “Your Choices” below.</p>

    <h5>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h5>

    <p>We use various technologies, including cookies, web beacons, to collect information concerning your online activities, such as the device and browser information, the pages you visit and the content you view. We may also use third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) to obtain such information.

        Cookies are small data files stored on your computer or portable device when you visit certain web pages. They are used as a mechanism for websites to remember things that a website browser has done in the past, for example, clicking on certain buttons or logging in at a previous time. Cookies help us improve the user experience and allow us to personalize our Services, assess which areas and features of our Services are popular and understand customers' usage of the Services.

        Essential Cookies (also known as Strictly Necessary Cookies): these are cookies that are required for the operation of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website and use the shopping cart feature when making purchases.
        Analytical/Performance Cookies: these allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users can find what they are looking for easily.
        Functionality Cookies: these are used to improve the functional performance of the website and make it easier for customers to use the website. For example, they are used to remember that you have previously visited the website and asked to remain logged in to the website.
        Targeting Cookies: These cookies record your visit to our website and your browsing habits, such as the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. They are used to deliver advertising which is more relevant to your interests and may also be used to limit the number of times that you see an advertisement. They may be placed by us or by advertising networks with our permission. Please note, these cookies do not contain any of your personal information.</p>

    <h5>Managing Cookies</h5>

    <p>You can manage cookies by activating the setting on your internet browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. Please refer to the instructions or the online help files available via your relevant browser if you wish to manage cookies in this way. Alternatively, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org for further information. To manage cookies relating to targeted advertising activities, you can visit www.youronlinechoices.com. To opt-out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you can visit tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

        Please note, if you refuse cookies this may mean that you can't use some of the additional features of our website and may not be able to access certain parts of the website.</p>

    <h5>Changes to Our Cookies Policy</h5>

    <p>We aim to meet high standards and our policies and procedures are, therefore, constantly under review. From time to time we may change how we use and place cookies. Accordingly we recommend that you check this page periodically in order to review our current policies and practices.

        For questions about cookies please contact us via the Contact Us information below.

        Web beacons are electronic images that often interact with cookies and are generally used to monitor the behavior of the Services' users. Similar to cookies, we use web beacons to help deliver cookies, count visits and understand usage and campaign effectiveness.

        We may also include third party cookies on our site, and the collection, use and choice related to these third party cookies can be found on such third party sites. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see Your Choices below.

        We may use business analytics service providers to provide us with analytics concerning the Services and user behavior. These service providers may collect your usage information, IP address, browser information, device type, and similar personal information with respect to the various browsers and devices you use to access and use the Services.</p>

    <h5>Information We Collect From Other Sources</h5>

    <p>We may also obtain personal information from other sources and combine that with personal information we collect directly. For example, we may collect personal information about you from third parties, including but not limited to identity verification services, fraud detection service providers, credit bureaus, mailing list providers and publicly available sources. If you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain personal information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.
        How We Use the Information We Collect

        We use the personal information we collect primarily to provide you with the products and services you purchase or use from our Application and Site (either directly or through third parties), to operate, maintain, support, host, enhance and improve the Services and your user experience, in order to meet our contractual obligations to others, comply with our obligations under applicable law, protect and exercise our legal rights, protect the security of our systems and the privacy of our customers, and otherwise protect or further our legitimate interests.

        We also use the personal information we collect to:

        facilitate transactions you engage in;
        communicate with you, including to provide customer service;
        monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with our Services;
        detect, investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities and protect the rights and property of EntranceX and others;
        personalize the Site and Application, including by providing advertisements, content or features that match user profiles or interests;
        complying with legal obligations, court orders or other legal process and instructions of competent authorities;
        exercising or protecting our rights in contract or by law (including in any dispute resolution process) or the rights of our users or business partners, including enforcing our terms of use and preventing or protecting against any illegal or authorized activities</p>

    <h5>Sharing Your Personal Data</h5>

    <p>We share your personal information as set out in this privacy policy. We may also share your personal information as described below:
        EntranceX's Vendors and Providers

        Many of the operations we perform require us to hire other companies to help us with these tasks. For example, SeatGeek retains companies to help us handle mail and email (including sending and delivering packages, postal mail and email), market our products and services, handle purchases of tickets to certain events, process credit card transactions, and provide customer service. The companies we retain to help us with these tasks have access to personal information to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
        EntranceX's Subsidiaries and Affiliates

        We may share your personal information with EntranceX's affiliates and subsidiaries, based on our legitimate interest. Our affiliates and subsidiaries may use your personal information solely for the purposes set out in the "How We Use the Information We Collect" paragraph above.
        External Service Providers, Event Providers, and EntranceX Users

        When you use the Services to purchase or sell tickets, we may provide personal information to the ticket seller, team, venue, promoters, league, or other third party involved in the sale of the ticket or otherwise related to the event. We may even ask you to transact directly with that third party vendor. For example, when you purchase a ticket, we may share your personal information (excluding payment information) with the seller of the ticket in order for the seller to complete the transaction. Similarly, when you purchase a ticket to an event (such as, but not limited to, a game or concert), we may provide your personal information to the teams you see, the league or organization that sanctioned the game, a concert promoter, and/or the operator of the venue or facility that hosted the event. Additionally, we may share information with third parties to assist in processing your payment with the seller, or a payment to you, if you are the seller. These third parties may use your personal information for analytics, offering you other products or services, preparation of reports, ticket fulfillment, as well as customer service and other legitimate business uses.</p>

    <h5>Third-Party Companies</h5>

    <p>We may enter into agreements with companies (including, for example, by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website) that offer their products or services on our Site or Application ("Third-Party Companies"), and you may be asked to transact directly with those Third-Party Companies relating to your purchase of tickets. As a result, we may disclose your personal information to the Third-Party Companies that co-brand their products and services on our Site or Application. Because we do not control the privacy practices of Third-Party Companies, you should read and understand their privacy policies.</p>

    <h5>Future Business Transfers</h5>

    <p>Our business is constantly changing. In the event EntranceX goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred.</p>

    <h5>Compliance with Law and Protection of EntranceX</h5>

    <p>EntranceX reserves the right to disclose personal information in order to comply with the law. We may also disclose personal information to enforce or apply the terms and conditions applicable to our products and services, or protect the rights, property or safety of EntranceX, our users, or others.</p>

    <h5>De-Identified Data</h5>

    <p>We may share personal information in an aggregated and anonymized form , which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</p>

    <h5>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others</h5>

    <p>We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and in applications. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Application or Site and other websites and applications, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked,information about your location, and conversion information. This information may be used by SeatGeek and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and to deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Site and Application and other websites and applications. For more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for interest-based advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices. Your device may also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through applications used for interest-based advertising purposes. See “Your Choices” below for information about how to control the collection of location information by SeatGeek.
        How long do we keep your personal information for?

        We retain your personal information for no longer than is necessary for fulfilling the purposes set out in this policy.

        We apply different retention policies for different types of personal information. The retention period is dictated by certain factors, such as the type of personal information, the purpose for which the data was collected, the legal basis permitting us to collect and store it, statutory requirements, industry guidelines, our legitimate interests in providing the Services or protecting our legal rights etc.

        We continuously assess the retention periods in order to ensure that we do not keep your personal information more than is absolutely necessary for processing purposes. When we no longer have a legitimate reason or legal requirement to process your personal information, we will delete it or store it in an anonymized and aggregated manner that no longer identifies you.

        For example, if you close your account with us, we may retain in our files certain information associated with your account and past transactions for purposes of backups, fraud prevention, dispute resolution, investigations, and compliance with legal requirements.</p>


    <h5>Your Choices</h5>
    <h6>How You Can Access or Change Your Personal Data</h6>

Please note that, even if you opt out of promotional emails, we may still send you service-related communications.</p>



    <h5>Location Information</h5>

    <p>You may be asked to consent to the Application’s collection of location information. If we collect your location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device. You may also stop our collection of location information by following the standard uninstall process to remove all of our mobile applications from your device.</p>

    <h5>Protecting Your Personal Information</h5>

    <p>As part of our efforts to prevent unauthorized access to personal information, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information, we employ reasonable and current security methods and technologies. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our servers, nor can we guarantee that your personal information will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.</p>

    <h5>Connections and Links to Other Services and Applications</h5>

    <p>The Services may include links and connections to third-party services and applications. We have no control over and are not responsible for the information that is submitted to, collected or processed by such third-party services or applications and this privacy policy does not cover any data collection or processing by such third-party services or applications. You are encouraged to carefully read the privacy policies and the terms of use of those third-party services or applications to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.</p>

    <h5>Amendments to this Privacy Policy</h5>

    <p>If EntranceX decides to change our Privacy Policy, we will post the updated policy within the Application, on this page, and/or the homepage of the Site, and/or other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, and/or by email, and/or by means of a notice on our homepage.</p>
